    * Total Income vs. Total Expense Bar Chart.
    * Horizontal Bar Chart for detailed spending by category.
    * Doughnut Chart for proportional expense breakdown.
* **Receipt Scanning**: Users can upload an image of a receipt, and the application will use OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to automatically extract the total amount.
* **Data Filtering**: The transaction list can be filtered by a specific date range.
* **Dual Theme**: A persistent dark/light mode toggle for user comfort.
